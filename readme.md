# Ready Set SQL

Ready Set SQL is a nodejs webapp providing a platform for learning SQL. In particular PostgreSQL. 

**It's still be wrapped up**, but check it out at [http://www.readysetsql.com](http://www.readysetsql.com).

This is the Heroku/Postgres-compatible, non-client-MVC, and simplified version of my previous attempt at this. 
As such, the code probably has lots of artifacts from the learning process and the many rewrites due to me changing my mind 
and experimenting. Take this into consideration if you attempt to explore the inner-workings of this application, or extend 
it for your own uses.
