# The lesson title

Some blurb in the beginning about what we're going to cover in the lesson.
An introduction of sorts. Maybe it recaps previous lessons that are
going to be used and expanded  upon here. Or maybe it just jumps right in.

blah blah blah more text here. 
You should totally do a thing where blah.

Type this query into your editor to get a feel for what it does

```sql
SELECT 
	* 
FROM 
	pizza
WHERE 
	pizza_description LIKE '%cheese%'
```
